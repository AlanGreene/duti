* About duti 

    duti is a command-line utility capable of setting default applications for
various document types on Mac OS X, using Apple's Uniform Type Identifiers. A
UTI is a unique string describing the format of a file's content. For instance,
a Microsoft Word document has a UTI of com.microsoft.word.doc. Using duti, the
user can change which application acts as the default handler for a given UTI.

* Compiling

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

* Usage

    duti can read settings from three different sources: 1) standard input;
2) a settings file; or 3) a Mac OS X XML property list (plist). A settings
line, as read in cases 1 and 2, consists of an application's bundle ID, a UTI,
and a string describing what role the application handles for the given UTI.
The process is similar when duti processes a plist. See the man page for
additional usage details.

* Examples

    Set Safari as the default handler for HTML documents:
	% duti
	com.apple.Safari	public.html	all
	^D

    Set TextEdit as the default handler for Word documents:
	% duti
	com.apple.TextEdit	com.microsoft.word.doc	all
	^D
